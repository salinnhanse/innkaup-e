# Design Report

## Introduction

The objective of this project is to make a TicTacToe game focusing on test driven development. 

## User Stories

In the beginning we created a couple of user stories to create conversations about the project and how we would like to design our system.

|  #  | User Story |
|---|---|
|  1  |  As a casual user I can play against another user on the same computer. |  
|  2  |  As a casual user I can see instructions about how to play the game. | 
|  3  |  As a casual user I can play the game against the computer.  | 
|  4  |  As a casual user I can play again. |

## Class Diagram

This is the initial design we came up with after the user story conversations, obviously it is incomplete and more attributes and functions were added as development continued.

## Coding Rules

### Naming conventions

Class names use Pascal casing and attributes and functions use camel casing.

### Comments

Comments should be above functions.

### Indents

Indents should be a single tab where a tab is 4 spaces.
